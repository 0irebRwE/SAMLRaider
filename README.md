# SAML Raider - SAML2 Burp Extension

## Description

SAML Raider is a Burp Suite extension for testing SAML infrastructures. It
contains two core functionalities: Manipulating SAML Messages and manage X.509
certificates.

This software was created by Roland Bischofberger and Emanuel Duss during
a bachelor thesis at the [Hochschule f√ºr Technik
Rapperswil](https://www.hsr.ch) (HSR). Our project partner and advisor was
[Compass Security Schweiz AG](https://www.csnc.ch). We thank Compass for the
nice collaboration and support during our bachelor thesis.

## Features

The extension is divided in two parts. A SAML message editor and a certificate
management tool.

## Download

Download: [saml-raider-1.0.0.jar](https://github.com/SAMLRaider/SAMLRaider/releases/download/v1.0.0/saml-raider-1.0.0.jar)

## Installation

Start the Burp Suite and click at the `Extender` tab on `Add`. Choose the SAML
Raider JAR file to install the extension.


## Usage

To test SAML environments more comfortable, you could add a intercept rule in
the proxy settings. Add a new rule which checks if a Parameter Name
`SAMLResponse` is in the request. We hope the usage of our extension is mostly
self explaining :smile:.

## Build

Clone the repository and build the JAR file using Maven:

    $ mvn install

Use the JAR file in `target/saml-raider-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
as a Burp extension.

## Bachelor Thesis

As soon as our thesis is online, we will publish the link here.
